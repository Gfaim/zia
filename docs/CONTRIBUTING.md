## Conventions

**Git Commits**

We use the [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification for git commits.

**Git Branches**

We use the following syntax for naming git branches

```
<keyword>/<branch_name>-<issue_id>

feat/billing-module-76
fix/http-header-parser-167
fix/module-loader-12
```

Some branches like `main`, `dev`, `hotfix` do not follow that convention.

**C++**

We use the [Google C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

**Issues and Pull Requests**

Make sure your pull request and issue names are human readable titles such as `Missing const qualifier on method` for an issue or `Support for HTTP 3` for a pull request. Automatically generated names from Github such as `Feat/my feature` are to be avoided.
